1521,pub.1174720501,10.48550/arxiv.2408.06810,,,HLSPilot: LLM-based High-Level Synthesis,"Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed an upsurge in automatic code
generation, garnering significant attention for register transfer level (RTL)
code generation. Despite the potential of RTL code generation with natural
language, it remains error-prone and limited to relatively small modules
because of the substantial semantic gap between natural language expressions
and hardware design intent. In response to the limitations, we propose a
methodology that reduces the semantic gaps by utilizing C/C++ for generating
hardware designs via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools. Basically, we build a
set of C-to-HLS optimization strategies catering to various code patterns, such
as nested loops and local arrays. Then, we apply these strategies to sequential
C/C++ code through in-context learning, which provides the LLMs with exemplary
C/C++ to HLS prompts. With this approach, HLS designs can be generated
effectively. Since LLMs still face problems in determining the optimized pragma
parameters precisely, we have a design space exploration (DSE) tool integrated
for pragma parameter tuning. Furthermore, we also employ profiling tools to
pinpoint the performance bottlenecks within a program and selectively convert
bottleneck components to HLS code for hardware acceleration. By combining the
LLM-based profiling, C/C++ to HLS translation, and DSE, we have established
HLSPilot, the first LLM-enabled high-level synthesis framework, which can fully
automate the high-level application acceleration on hybrid CPU-FPGA
architectures. According to our experiments on real-world application
benchmarks, HLSPilot achieve comparable performance in general and can even
outperform manually crafted counterparts, thereby underscoring the substantial
promise of LLM-assisted hardware designs.",,,arXiv,,,,2024-08-13,2024,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Xiong, Chenwei; Liu, Cheng; Li, Huawei; Li, Xiaowei","Xiong, Chenwei (); Liu, Cheng (); Li, Huawei (); Li, Xiaowei ()",,"Xiong, Chenwei (); Liu, Cheng (); Li, Huawei (); Li, Xiaowei ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174720501,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

challenges in achieving high performance while maintaining design productivity.
High-level synthesis (HLS) has been adopted as a solution, but the mismatch
between the high-level description and the physical layout often leads to
suboptimal operating frequency. Although existing proposals for high-level
physical synthesis, which use coarse-grained design partitioning,
floorplanning, and pipelining to improve frequency, have gained traction, they
lack a framework enabling (1) pipelining of real-world designs at arbitrary
hierarchical levels, (2) integration of HLS blocks, vendor IPs, and handcrafted
RTL designs, (3) portability to emerging new target FPGA devices, and (4)
extensibility for the easy implementation of new design optimization tools.
  We present RapidStream IR, a practical high-level physical synthesis (HLPS)
infrastructure for representing the composition of complex FPGA designs and
exploring physical optimizations. Our approach introduces a flexible
intermediate representation (IR) that captures interconnection protocols at
arbitrary hierarchical levels, coarse-grained pipelining, and spatial
information, enabling the creation of reusable passes for design frequency
optimizations. RapidStream IR improves the frequency of a broad set of
mixed-source designs by 7% to 62%, including large language models and genomics
accelerators, and is portable to user-customizable new FPGA platforms. We
further demonstrate its extensibility through case studies, showcasing the

parameters have generated a significant demand for efficient deployment in
inference workloads. The majority of existing approaches rely on temporal
architectures that reuse hardware units for different network layers and
operators. However, these methods often encounter challenges in achieving low
latency due to considerable memory access overhead. This paper investigates the
feasibility and potential of model-specific spatial acceleration for LLM
inference on FPGAs. Our approach involves the specialization of distinct
hardware units for specific operators or layers, facilitating direct
communication between them through a dataflow architecture while minimizing
off-chip memory accesses. We introduce a comprehensive analytical model for
estimating the performance of a spatial LLM accelerator, taking into account
the on-chip compute and memory resources available on an FPGA. Through our
analysis, we can determine the scenarios in which FPGA-based spatial
acceleration can outperform its GPU-based counterpart. To enable more
productive implementations of an LLM model on FPGAs, we further provide a
library of high-level synthesis (HLS) kernels that are composable and reusable.
This library will be made available as open-source. To validate the
effectiveness of both our analytical model and HLS library, we have implemented
BERT and GPT2 on an AMD Alveo U280 FPGA device. Experimental results
demonstrate our approach can achieve up to 13.4x speedup when compared to
previous FPGA-based accelerators for the BERT model. For GPT generative
inference, we attain a 2.2x speedup compared to DFX, an FPGA overlay, in the

for deep learning applications and are used widely in training and inference of
transformers; transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
areas of machine learning and are especially used in most modern Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, GPUs require large amounts of energy, which poses
environmental concerns, demands high operational costs, and causes GPUs to be
unsuitable for edge computing. We develop an accelerator for transformers,
namely, Llama 2, an open-source state-of-the-art LLM, using high level
synthesis (HLS) on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). HLS allows us to
rapidly prototype FPGA designs without writing code at the register-transfer
level (RTL). We name our method HLSTransform, and the FPGA designs we
synthesize with HLS achieve up to a 12.75x reduction and 8.25x reduction in
energy used per token on the Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ VU9P FPGA compared to an
Intel Xeon Broadwell E5-2686 v4 CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU respectively, while
increasing inference speeds by up to 2.46x compared to CPU and maintaining
0.53x the speed of an RTX 3090 GPU despite the GPU's 4 times higher base clock
rate. With the lack of existing open-source FPGA accelerators for transformers,
we open-source our code and document our steps for synthesis. We hope this work
will serve as a step in democratizing the use of FPGAs in transformer inference

The scarcity of open-source HLS codebases, especially those containing bugs, poses a significant challenge, as LLMs require extensive datasets for efficient fine-tuning and evaluation. To tackle this, we introduce an innovative bug injection methodology working with a new dataset that we curated from a wide range of open-source HLS benchmark suites. This dataset features over 1,500 designs, with both the version injected with bugs and the corresponding bug-free version. Our bug injection method synergizes In-Context Learning (ICL) with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Chain of Thought (CoT). This approach significantly boosts the datasetâs overall validity rate for single-bug injections. We demonstrate our solution quality using GPT-4 Turbo for injecting either logic bugs or non-ideal pragmas (compiler directives) into HLS designs. For logic bugs, we achieve an 84.8% ratio for valid injection attempts. Furthermore, our approach maintains an 88.0% dataset validity rate (the valid bug injection rate). In addition, we also evaluate the quality of HLS pragma injections (focusing on non-ideal pragmas), and achieve a 74.0% attempt and an 87.9% valid injection ratio.

To enable more productive implementations of an LLM model on FPGAs, we further provide a library of high-level synthesis (HLS) kernels that are composable and reusable. To validate the effectiveness of both our analytical model and HLS library, we have implemented BERT and GPT2 on an AMD Alveo U280 FPGA. Experimental results demonstrate our approach can achieve up to 16.1x speedup when compared to previous FPGA-based accelerators for the BERT model. For GPT generative inference, we attain a 2.2x speedup compared to DFX, an FPGA overlay, in the prefill stage, while achieving a 1.9x speedup and a 5.7x improvement in energy efficiency compared to the NVIDIA A100 GPU in the decode stage.",,,,Proceedings of the 2024 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field Programmable Gate Arrays,,,2024-04-02,2024,2024-04-02,2024-04,,,185-185,Closed,Proceeding,"Chen, Hongzheng; Zhang, Jiahao; Du, Yixiao; Xiang, Shaojie; Yue, Zichao; Zhang, Niansong; Cai, Yaohui; Zhang, Zhiru","Chen, Hongzheng (Cornell University, Ithaca, USA); Zhang, Jiahao (Tsinghua University, Beijing, China); Du, Yixiao (Cornell University, Ithaca, USA); Xiang, Shaojie (Cornell University, Ithaca, USA); Yue, Zichao (Cornell University, Ithaca, USA); Zhang, Niansong (Cornell University, Ithaca, USA); Cai, Yaohui (Cornell University, Ithaca, USA); Zhang, Zhiru (Cornell University, Ithaca, USA)",,"Chen, Hongzheng (Cornell University); Zhang, Jiahao (Tsinghua University); Du, Yixiao (Cornell University); Xiang, Shaojie (Cornell University); Yue, Zichao (Cornell University); Zhang, Niansong (Cornell University); Cai, Yaohui (Cornell University); Zhang, Zhiru (Cornell University)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170335282,"33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture; 40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

enabled users to deploy them on more and more resource-constrained edge devices
to reduce reliance on network connections and provide more privacy. However,
the high computation and memory demands of LLMs make their execution on
resource-constrained edge devices challenging and inefficient. To address this
issue, designing new and efficient edge accelerators for LLM inference is
crucial. FPGA-based accelerators are ideal for LLM acceleration due to their
reconfigurability, as they enable model-specific optimizations and higher
performance per watt. However, creating and integrating FPGA-based accelerators
for LLMs (particularly on edge devices) has proven challenging, mainly due to
the limited hardware design flows for LLMs in existing FPGA platforms.
  To tackle this issue, in this paper we first propose a new design platform,
named SECDA-LLM, that utilizes the SECDA methodology to streamline the process
of designing, integrating, and deploying efficient FPGA-based LLM accelerators
for the llama.cpp inference framework. We then demonstrate, through a case
study, the potential benefits of SECDA-LLM by creating a new MatMul accelerator
that supports block floating point quantized operations for LLMs. Our initial

machine learning applications, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), in the
data center. There has been much evidence showing that single FPGAs can be
competitive with GPUs in performance for some computations, especially for low
latency, and often much more efficient when power is considered. This suggests
that there is merit to exploring the use of multiple FPGAs for large machine
learning applications. The challenge with using multiple FPGAs is that there is
no commonly-accepted flow for developing and deploying multi-FPGA applications,
i.e., there are no tools to describe a large application, map it to multiple
FPGAs and then deploy the application on a multi-FPGA platform. In this paper,
we explore the feasibility of implementing large transformers using multiple
FPGAs by developing a scalable multi-FPGA platform and some tools to map large
applications to the platform. We validate our approach by designing an
efficient multi-FPGA version of the I-BERT transformer and implement one
encoder using six FPGAs as a working proof-of-concept to show that our platform
and tools work. Based on our proof-of-concept prototype and the estimations of
performance using the latest FPGAs compared to GPUs, we conclude that there can
be a place for FPGAs in the world of large machine learning applications. We
demonstrate a promising first step that shows that with the right
infrastructure and tools it is reasonable to continue to explore the possible
benefits of using FPGAs for applications such as LLMs.",,,arXiv,,,,2024-04-24,2024,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Gao, Yu; Vega, Juan Camilo; Chow, Paul","Gao, Yu (); Vega, Juan Camilo (); Chow, Paul ()",,"Gao, Yu (); Vega, Juan Camilo (); Chow, Paul ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171095269,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,

the increase in the number of parameters. This has led to substantial memory
capacity requirements, necessitating the use of dozens of GPUs just to meet the
capacity. One popular solution to this is storage-offloaded training, which
uses host memory and storage as an extended memory hierarchy. However, this
obviously comes at the cost of storage bandwidth bottleneck because storage
devices have orders of magnitude lower bandwidth compared to that of GPU device
memories. Our work, Smart-Infinity, addresses the storage bandwidth bottleneck
of storage-offloaded LLM training using near-storage processing devices on a
real system. The main component of Smart-Infinity is SmartUpdate, which
performs parameter updates on custom near-storage accelerators. We identify
that moving parameter updates to the storage side removes most of the storage
traffic. In addition, we propose an efficient data transfer handler structure
to address the system integration issues for Smart-Infinity. The handler allows
overlapping data transfers with fixed memory consumption by reusing the device
buffer. Lastly, we propose accelerator-assisted gradient
compression/decompression to enhance the scalability of Smart-Infinity. When
scaling to multiple near-storage processing devices, the write traffic on the
shared channel becomes the bottleneck. To alleviate this, we compress the
gradients on the GPU and decompress them on the accelerators. It provides
further acceleration from reduced traffic. As a result, Smart-Infinity achieves
a significant speedup compared to the baseline. Notably, Smart-Infinity is a

models, thus reducing orders of magnitude of computational demands. However,
RALMs introduce unique system design challenges due to (a) the diverse workload
characteristics between LM inference and retrieval and (b) the various system
requirements and bottlenecks for different RALM configurations such as model
sizes, database sizes, and retrieval frequencies. We propose Chameleon, a
heterogeneous accelerator system that integrates both LM and retrieval
accelerators in a disaggregated architecture. The heterogeneity ensures
efficient acceleration of both LM inference and retrieval, while the
accelerator disaggregation enables the system to independently scale both types
of accelerators to fulfill diverse RALM requirements. Our Chameleon prototype
implements retrieval accelerators on FPGAs and assigns LM inference to GPUs,
with a CPU server orchestrating these accelerators over the network. Compared
to CPU-based and CPU-GPU vector search systems, Chameleon achieves up to 23.72x
speedup and 26.2x energy efficiency. Evaluated on various RALMs, Chameleon
exhibits up to 2.16x reduction in latency and 3.18x speedup in throughput
compared to the hybrid CPU-GPU architecture. These promising results pave the
way for bringing accelerator heterogeneity and disaggregation into future RALM
systems.",,,arXiv,,,,2023-10-15,2023,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Jiang, Wenqi; Zeller, Marco; Waleffe, Roger; Hoefler, Torsten; Alonso, Gustavo","Jiang, Wenqi (); Zeller, Marco (); Waleffe, Roger (); Hoefler, Torsten (); Alonso, Gustavo ()",,"Jiang, Wenqi (); Zeller, Marco (); Waleffe, Roger (); Hoefler, Torsten (); Alonso, Gustavo ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164952289,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Various program scripts have been introduced to automate this process. But the resulting codes usually contain many issues that should be manually repaired by developers. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automate code generation, they can also be used for automated program repair in HLS. However, due to the limited training of LLMs considering hardware and software simultaneously, hallucinations may occur during program repair using LLMs, leading to compilation failures. Besides, using LLMs for iterative repair also incurs a high cost. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-driven program repair framework that takes regular $\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{C}++$ code as input and automatically generates its corresponding HLS-C code for synthesis while minimizing human repair effort. To mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs and enhance the prompt quality, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm is introduced to guide the LLMs toward correct repair. In addition, we use LLMs to create a static bit width optimization program to identify the optimized bit widths for variables. Moreover, LLM-driven HLS optimization strategies are introduced to add/tune pragmas in HLS-C programs for circuit optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-driven automated framework can achieve much higher repair pass rates in 24 real-world applications compared with the traditional scripts and the direct application of LLMs for program repair.

benchmarked the performance of our proposed scheme using the open-source
VerilogEval dataset, for four different industry-scale LLMs, and the Vitis HLS

performance improvements in emerging applications, especially as the benefits
of technology scaling continue to diminish. However, designers currently lack
effective tools and methodologies to construct complex, high-performance
accelerator architectures in a productive manner. Existing high-level synthesis
(HLS) tools often require intrusive source-level changes to attain satisfactory
quality of results. Despite the introduction of several new accelerator design
languages (ADLs) aiming to enhance or replace HLS, their advantages are more
evident in relatively simple applications with a single kernel. Existing ADLs
prove less effective for realistic hierarchical designs with multiple kernels,
even if the design hierarchy is flattened.
  In this paper, we introduce Allo, a composable programming model for
efficient spatial accelerator design. Allo decouples hardware customizations,
including compute, memory, communication, and data type from algorithm
specification, and encapsulates them as a set of customization primitives. Allo
preserves the hierarchical structure of an input program by combining
customizations from different functions in a bottom-up, type-safe manner. This
approach facilitates holistic optimizations that span across function
boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly-used HLS
benchmarks and several realistic deep learning models. Our evaluation shows
that Allo can outperform state-of-the-art HLS tools and ADLs on all test cases
in the PolyBench. For the GPT2 model, the inference latency of the Allo
generated accelerator is 1.7x faster than the NVIDIA A100 GPU with 5.4x higher

To facilitate DSA designs, programmers use high-level synthesis (HLS) to compile a high-level description written in C/C++ into a design with low-level hardware description languages that eventually synthesize DSAs on circuits. However, creating a high-quality HLS design still demands significant domain knowledge, particularly in microarchitecture decisions expressed as pragmas. Thus, it is desirable to automate such decisions with the help of machine learning for predicting the quality of HLS designs, requiring a deeper understanding of the program that consists of original code and pragmas. Naturally, these programs can be considered as sequence data. In addition, these programs can be compiled and converted into a control data flow graph (CDFG). But existing works either fail to leverage both modalities or combine the two in shallow or coarse ways. We propose PROGSG, a model that allows interaction between the source code sequence modality and the graph modality in a deep and fine-grained way. To alleviate the scarcity of labeled designs, a pre-training method is proposed based on a suite of compilerâs data flow analysis tasks. Experimental results show that PROGSG reduces the RMSE of design performance predictions by up to 22%, and identifies designs with an average of 1.10Ã and 1.26Ã (up to 8.17Ã and 13.31Ã) performance improvement in design space exploration (DSE) task compared to HARP and AutoDSE, respectively.

The GPT model has heavy memory and computing overhead, and its inference process has two stages with distinct computing characteristics: Prefill and Decode. Utilizing existing GPUs and FPGA accelerators to construct a platform for deploying GPT in data centers faces the challenges of needing more effective synchronization schemes or structures with higher computational intensity. This paper proposes LORA, a low latency end-to-end GPT acceleration platform utilizing multiple FPGAs. Firstly, we optimize the synchronization timing of the GPT model to reduce the computation and communication overhead. Secondly, we devise some efficient synchronization steps for specific layers of the GPT model that overlap part of the computation and communication delay to improve the latency of our platform. Finally, we deploy recurrent structures on each FPGA to accelerate the different stages of the GPT model. Implemented on the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGAs, LORA achieves an average $11.1 \times$ speedup over NVIDIA V100 GPUs on the modern GPT-2 model. Compared to the existing multi-FPGA accelerator appliance, LORA shows performance improvements of up to $4 \times$ and $2.7 \times$ in the Prefill and Decode stages.","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&amp;D Program of China under Grants 2022YFB4501600 and 2022YFB4501603, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62102383, 61976200, and 62172380, in part by Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation under Grant BK20210123, in part by Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS under Grant Y2021121.","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grants 2022YFB4501600 and 2022YFB4501603, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62102383, 61976200, and 62172380, in part by Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation under Grant BK20210123, in part by Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS under Grant Y2021121.",,2024 34th International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL),,,2024-01-06,2024,,2024-01-06,00,,332-338,Closed,Proceeding,"Zheng, ZhenDong; Cheng, Qianyu; Wang, Teng; Gong, Lei; Chen, Xianglan; Tang, Cheng; Wang, Chao; Zhou, Xuehai","Zheng, ZhenDong (School of Computer Science and Technology, Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research University of Science and Technology of China); Cheng, Qianyu (School of Computer Science and Technology, Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research University of Science and Technology of China); Wang, Teng (School of Computer Science and Technology, Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research University of Science and Technology of China); Gong, Lei (School of Computer Science and Technology, Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research University of Science and Technology of China); Chen, Xianglan (School of Computer Science and Technology, Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research University of Science and Technology of China); Tang, Cheng (School of Computer Science and Technology, Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research University of Science and Technology of China); Wang, Chao (School of Computer Science and Technology, Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research University of Science and Technology of China); Zhou, Xuehai (School of Computer Science and Technology, Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research University of Science and Technology of China)","Wang, Teng (University of Science and Technology of China); Gong, Lei (University of Science and Technology of China)","Zheng, ZhenDong (University of Science and Technology of China); Cheng, Qianyu (University of Science and Technology of China); Wang, Teng (University of Science and Technology of China); Gong, Lei (University of Science and Technology of China); Chen, Xianglan (University of Science and Technology of China); Tang, Cheng (University of Science and Technology of China); Wang, Chao (University of Science and Technology of China); Zhou, Xuehai (University of Science and Technology of China)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1181200825,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,

accelerators (DSAs), such as Google's TPUs, for accelerating various
applications such as deep learning, search, autonomous driving, etc. To
facilitate DSA designs, high-level synthesis (HLS) is used, which allows a
developer to compile a high-level description in the form of software code in C
and C++ into a design in low-level hardware description languages (such as VHDL
or Verilog) and eventually synthesized into a DSA on an ASIC
(application-specific integrated circuit) or FPGA (field-programmable gate
arrays). However, existing HLS tools still require microarchitecture decisions,
expressed in terms of pragmas (such as directives for parallelization and
pipelining). To enable more people to design DSAs, it is desirable to automate
such decisions with the help of deep learning for predicting the quality of HLS
designs. This requires us a deeper understanding of the program, which is a
combination of original code and pragmas. Naturally, these programs can be
considered as sequence data, for which large language models (LLM) can help. In
addition, these programs can be compiled and converted into a control data flow
graph (CDFG), and the compiler also provides fine-grained alignment between the
code tokens and the CDFG nodes. However, existing works either fail to leverage
both modalities or combine the two in shallow or coarse ways. We propose ProgSG

with each other in a deep and fine-grained way. To alleviate the scarcity of

various research disciplines, including the wireless communication community.
There have been several heated discussions on the intersection of LLMs and
wireless technologies. While recent studies have demonstrated the ability of
LLMs to generate hardware description language (HDL) code for simple
computation tasks, developing wireless prototypes and products via HDL poses
far greater challenges because of the more complex computation tasks involved.
In this paper, we aim to address this challenge by investigating the role of
LLMs in FPGA-based hardware development for advanced wireless signal
processing. We begin by exploring LLM-assisted code refactoring, reuse, and
validation, using an open-source software-defined radio (SDR) project as a case
study. Through the case study, we find that an LLM assistant can potentially
yield substantial productivity gains for researchers and developers. We then
examine the feasibility of using LLMs to generate HDL code for advanced
wireless signal processing, using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm as
an example. This task presents two unique challenges: the scheduling of
subtasks within the overall task and the multi-step thinking required to solve
certain arithmetic problem within the task. To address these challenges, we
employ in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
techniques, culminating in the successful generation of a 64-point Verilog FFT
module. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLMs for generalization and
imitation, affirming their usefulness in writing HDL code for wireless
communication systems. Overall, this work contributes to understanding the role
of LLMs in wireless communication and motivates further exploration of their
capabilities.",,,arXiv,,,,2023-07-14,2023,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Du, Yuyang; Deng, Hongyu; Liew, Soung Chang; Chen, Kexin; Shao, Yulin; Chen, He","Du, Yuyang (); Deng, Hongyu (); Liew, Soung Chang (); Chen, Kexin (); Shao, Yulin (); Chen, He ()",,"Du, Yuyang (); Deng, Hongyu (); Liew, Soung Chang (); Chen, Kexin (); Shao, Yulin (); Chen, He ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160754753,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,

window that permits the model to attend to every token in the inputs. Previous
works in recurrent models can memorize past tokens to enable unlimited context
and maintain effectiveness. However, they have ""flat"" memory architectures,
which have limitations in selecting and filtering information. Since humans are
good at learning and self-adjustment, we speculate that imitating brain memory
hierarchy is beneficial for model memorization. We propose the Hierarchical
Memory Transformer (HMT), a novel framework that enables and improves models'
long-context processing ability by imitating human memorization behavior.
Leveraging memory-augmented segment-level recurrence, we organize the memory
hierarchy by preserving tokens from early input token segments, passing memory
embeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history.
Evaluating general language modeling (Wikitext-103, PG-19) and
question-answering tasks (PubMedQA), we show that HMT steadily improves the
long-context processing ability of context-constrained and long-context models.
With an additional 0.5% - 2% of parameters, HMT can easily plug in and augment
future LLMs to handle long context effectively. Our code is open-sourced on

These include architectures such as the generative pretrained transformer (GPT) and the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). GPT-2 is a popular sequence learning architecture that uses transformer architecture. GPT-2 is trained on text prediction, and the network parameters obtained during this training process can be used in various other tasks like text classification and premise-hypothesis testing. Edge computing is an recent trend in which training is done on cloud or server with multiple GPUs, but inference is done on edge devices like mobile phones to reduce latency and improve privacy. This necessitates a study of GPT-2 performance and complexity to distill hardware-based architectures for their usability on edge devices. In this paper, a single layer of GPT-2 based inference architecture is implemented on Virtex-7 xc7vx485tffg1761-2 FPGA board. The inference engine has model dimensionality of 128 and latency of 1.637 ms while operating at 142.44 MHz, consuming 85.6K flip-flops and 96.8K lookup tables, achieving 1.73x speedup compared to previously reported work on transformer-based architecture.

have emerged as formidable tools, yet they typically augment rather than
redefine existing methodologies. These solutions often repurpose deep learning
models from other domains, such as vision, text, and graph analytics, applying
them to circuit design without tailoring to the unique complexities of
electronic circuits. Such an AI4EDA approach falls short of achieving a
holistic design synthesis and understanding, overlooking the intricate
interplay of electrical, logical, and physical facets of circuit data. This
paper argues for a paradigm shift from AI4EDA towards AI-native EDA,
integrating AI at the core of the design process. Pivotal to this vision is the
development of a multimodal circuit representation learning technique, poised
to provide a comprehensive understanding by harmonizing and extracting insights
from varied data sources, such as functional specifications, RTL designs,
circuit netlists, and physical layouts. We champion the creation of large
circuit models (LCMs) that are inherently multimodal, crafted to decode and
express the rich semantics and structures of circuit data, thus fostering more
resilient, efficient, and inventive design methodologies. Embracing this
AI-native philosophy, we foresee a trajectory that transcends the current
innovation plateau in EDA, igniting a profound shift-left in electronic design
methodology. The envisioned advancements herald not just an evolution of
existing EDA tools but a revolution, giving rise to novel instruments of design
tools that promise to radically enhance design productivity and inaugurate a
new epoch where the optimization of circuit performance, power, and area (PPA)
is achieved not incrementally, but through leaps that redefine the benchmarks
of electronic systems' capabilities.",,,arXiv,,,,2024-03-11,2024,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Chen, Lei; Chen, Yiqi; Chu, Zhufei; Fang, Wenji; Ho, Tsung-Yi; Huang, Ru; Huang, Yu; Khan, Sadaf; Li, Min; Li, Xingquan; Li, Yu; Liang, Yun; Liu, Jinwei; Liu, Yi; Lin, Yibo; Luo, Guojie; Shi, Zhengyuan; Sun, Guangyu; Tsaras, Dimitrios; Wang, Runsheng; Wang, Ziyi; Wei, Xinming; Xie, Zhiyao; Xu, Qiang; Xue, Chenhao; Yan, Junchi; Yang, Jun; Yu, Bei; Yuan, Mingxuan; Young, Evangeline F.

To achieve optimal performance, HLS tools rely on pragmas, which are directives inserted into the source code to guide the synthesis process, and these pragmas can have various settings and values that significantly impact the resulting hardware design. State-of-the-art ML-based HLS methods, such as HARP, first train a deep learning model, typically based on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to graph-based representations of the source code and its pragmas. They then perform design space exploration (DSE) to explore the pragma design space, rank candidate designs using the trained model, and return the top designs as the final designs. However, traditional DSE methods face challenges due to the highly nonlinear relationship between pragma settings and performance metrics, along with complex interactions between pragmas that affect performance in non-obvious ways. To address these challenges, we propose compareXplore, a novel approach that learns to compare hardware designs for effective HLS optimization. COMPAREXPLORE introduces a hybrid loss function that combines pairwise preference learning with pointwise performance prediction, enabling the model to capture both relative preferences and absolute performance values. Moreover, we introduce a novel Node Difference Attention module that focuses on the most informative differences between designs, enhancing the modelâs ability to identify critical pragmas impacting performance. compareXPLORE adopts a two-stage DSE approach, where a pointwise prediction model is used for the initial design pruning, followed by a pairwise comparison stage for precise performance verification. Experimental results demonstrate that comPAREXPLORE achieves significant improvements in ranking metrics and generates high-quality HLS results for the selected designs, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art method.

values (activations) in a more compact format, thereby directly reducing both
computational and memory cost in hardware. The quantization of recent large
language models (LLMs) faces challenges to achieve competitive memory density
compared to other models such as convolutional neural networks, since values in
LLMs require larger dynamic ranges.
  Current hardware can expedite computation for LLMs using compact numerical
formats such as low-bitwidth integers or floating-point numbers. Each has
advantages: integer operations simplify circuit design, whereas floating-point
calculations can enhance accuracy when a wider dynamic range is required. In
this work, we seek an efficient data format that combines the best of both
worlds: Microscaling (MX) formats. MX formats are efficient data formats that
achieve both large dynamic ranges and high memory density.
  In this paper, we propose a compiler named MASE for exploring mixed-precision
MX formats on dataflow hardware accelerators for LLM inference. Our main
contributions are twofold. First, we propose a novel orchestration abstraction
to explore both software and hardware optimizations with new data formats.
Second, MASE achieves LLM inference at an average precision of 4-bits, with
minimal to no accuracy degradation. To our knowledge, MASE represents the first
effort to harness fine-grain multi-precision MX formats in the design of LLM

Large Language Models (LLMs) allow natural language programming, however, struggle with complex concepts in hardware design. To address this, we propose a formula-LLM-based auto-generator for baseband hardware, called FLAG. FLAG enhances LLMsâ understanding of complex formulas, and decreases the demands for designersâ skills. We showcase the ability of FLAG by generating a polar encoder with code length 8 and parallelism 4. Additionally, a polar encoder with code length 1024 and parallelism 4 is generated by FLAG, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches.

Models (LLMs) in generating Register Transfer Level (RTL) code, with notable
advancements showcased by commercial models such as GPT-4 and Claude3-Opus.
However, these proprietary LLMs often raise concerns regarding privacy and
security. While open-source LLMs offer solutions to these concerns, they
typically underperform commercial models in RTL code generation tasks,
primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality open-source RTL datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce OriGen , a fully open-source framework
that incorporates self-reflection capabilities and a novel dataset augmentation
methodology for generating high-quality, large-scale RTL code. Our approach
employs a code-tocode augmentation technique to enhance the quality of
open-source RTL code datasets. Furthermore, OriGen can rectify syntactic errors
through a self-reflection process that leverages compiler feedback.
Experimental results demonstrate that OriGen significantly outperforms other
open-source alternatives in RTL code generation. It surpasses the previous
best-performing open-source LLM by 12.8% and even exceeds GPT-4 Turbo in the
pass@1 metric on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark. Moreover, OriGen exhibits

First, we apply quantization-aware training to quantize its weights to 4 -bit and activations to 8 -bit ($W 4 A 8$) with a negligible accuracy loss. Based on that, we propose a high-performance hybrid systolic array (hybridSA) architecture that natively executes convolution and attention operators across varying quantization bit-widths (e.g., $W 4 A 8$ and all 8 -bit $Q K^{T} V$ in attention). To improve computational efficiency, hybridSA integrates diverse DSP packing techniques into hybrid weightstationary and output-stationary dataflows that are optimized for convolution and attention. It also supports flexible dataflow transitions to address the distinct demands of its output sequence by subsequent nonlinear operators. Moreover, we observe that nonlinear operators become the new performance bottleneck after the acceleration of convolution and attention, and offload them onto the FPGA as well. To reduce the latency of each nonlinear operator, we pipeline its own execution at a fine granularity. To minimize the resource utilization of nonlinear operators, we carefully balance their execution with hybridSA in a coarse-grained pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that our low-bit ($W 4 A 8$) SDA accelerator on the embedded AMDXilinx ZCU102 FPGA achieves a speedup of $97.3 \times$ (which takes about $\mathrm{2 . 1}$ minutes for one SD inference), compared to the original SD-v1.5 model on the ARM Cortex-A53 CPU (which takes about 3.5 hours for one SD inference).

high-quality image generation given textual prompts. Their success has driven
the rapid development of production-grade diffusion models that consistently
increase in size and already contain billions of parameters. As a result,
state-of-the-art text-to-image models are becoming less accessible in practice,
especially in resource-limited environments. Post-training quantization (PTQ)
tackles this issue by compressing the pretrained model weights into lower-bit
representations. Recent diffusion quantization techniques primarily rely on
uniform scalar quantization, providing decent performance for the models
compressed to 4 bits. This work demonstrates that more versatile vector
quantization (VQ) may achieve higher compression rates for large-scale
text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we tailor vector-based PTQ
methods to recent billion-scale text-to-image models (SDXL and SDXL-Turbo), and
show that the diffusion models of 2B+ parameters compressed to around 3 bits
using VQ exhibit the similar image quality and textual alignment as previous
4-bit compression techniques.",,,arXiv,,,,2024-08-31,2024,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Egiazarian, Vage; Kuznedelev, Denis; Voronov, Anton; Svirschevski, Ruslan; Goin, Michael; Pavlov, Daniil; Alistarh, Dan; Baranchuk, Dmitry","Egiazarian, Vage (); Kuznedelev, Denis (); Voronov, Anton (); Svirschevski, Ruslan (); Goin, Michael (); Pavlov, Daniil (); Alistarh, Dan (); Baranchuk, Dmitry ()",,"Egiazarian, Vage (); Kuznedelev, Denis (); Voronov, Anton (); Svirschevski, Ruslan (); Goin, Michael (); Pavlov, Daniil (); Alistarh, Dan (); Baranchuk, Dmitry ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175372533,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation,

Many previous studies have devoted considerable effort to exploring efficient circuit designs for specific processing. However, the increasing size of systolic arrays forces us to process increasingly large workloads by dividing them into smaller pieces. Therefore, we propose a systolic array platform based on a two-dimensional FPGA plane in which multiple FPGAs are connected by a virtual network. The systolic array realized by this system can be freely customized in shape and size according to the target. Distributed memory access through off-chip memory on each FPGA board and simple stream processing enable scalable performance. This paper presents a preliminary implementation based on the proposed systolic array platform and its performance evaluation. The evaluation results show that the proposed method improves the processing performance in proportion to the number of FPGAs. The results also show that the proposed platform is highly scalable due to the small circuit area required, and that the processing performance depends on the network bandwidth, which means that recent high-bandwidth FPGA boards can be expected to significantly improve the performance.",,,,Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region,,,2024-01-18,2024,2024-01-19,2024-01-18,,,84-94,All OA; Hybrid,Proceeding,"Ueno, Tomohiro; Del Sozzo, Emanuele; Sano, Kentaro","Ueno, Tomohiro (Center for Computational Science, RIKEN, Japan); Del Sozzo, Emanuele (Center for Computational Science, RIKEN, Japan); Sano, Kentaro (Center for Computational Science, RIKEN, Japan)",,"Ueno, Tomohiro (RIKEN); Del Sozzo, Emanuele (RIKEN); Sano, Kentaro (RIKEN)",0,0,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3635035.3637285,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168088422,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable

cryptographic operations to leak sensitive information of encryption hardware.
Therefore, it is necessary to conduct power side-channel analysis for assessing
the susceptibility of cryptographic systems and mitigating potential risks.
Existing power side-channel analysis primarily focuses on post-silicon
implementations, which are inflexible in addressing design flaws, leading to
costly and time-consuming post-fabrication design re-spins. Hence, pre-silicon
power side-channel analysis is required for early detection of vulnerabilities
to improve design robustness. In this paper, we introduce SCAR, a novel
pre-silicon power side-channel analysis framework based on Graph Neural
Networks (GNN). SCAR converts register-transfer level (RTL) designs of
encryption hardware into control-data flow graphs and use that to detect the
design modules susceptible to side-channel leakage. Furthermore, we incorporate
a deep learning-based explainer in SCAR to generate quantifiable and
human-accessible explanation of our detection and localization decisions. We
have also developed a fortification component as a part of SCAR that uses
large-language models (LLM) to automatically generate and insert additional
design code at the localized zone to shore up the side-channel leakage. When
evaluated on popular encryption algorithms like AES, RSA, and PRESENT, and
postquantum cryptography algorithms like Saber and CRYSTALS-Kyber, SCAR,
achieves up to 94.49% localization accuracy, 100% precision, and 90.48% recall.
Additionally, through explainability analysis, SCAR reduces features for GNN

Moreover, the accuracy and efficiency of such systems is highly dependent on the adaptive algorithms they employ. A popular, adaptive beamforming algorithm, widely used in smart antennas, is the Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm. While, the classical RLS implementation achieves high convergence, it still suffers from its inability to track the target of interest. Recently, a new adaptive algorithm called Recursive Least Square - Least Mean Square (RLMS) which employs a RLS stage followed by a Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm stage and separated by an estimate of the array image vector, i.e. steering vector, has been proposed. RLMS outperforms previous RLS and LMS variants, with superior convergence and tracking capabilities, at the cost of a moderate increase in computational complexity. In this paper, an enhanced, low complexity parallel version of the cascade RLMS is presented by eliminating the need for computing the array image vector cascading stage. Hence, For an antenna of N elements our strategy can reduce the complexity of the system by 20N multiplications, 6N additions and 2N divisions. Moreover, a new Kalman based parallel RLMS (RKLMS) method is also proposed, where the LMS stage is replaced by a Kalman implementation of the classical LMS, and compared under low Signal to Interference plus Noise ratios (SINR). Simulation results show identical performance for the parallel RLMS, cascaded RLMS at 10dB and superior performance and robustness for the RKLMS on low SINR cases up to -10dB.",,,,2019 27th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO),,,2019-01-06,2019,,2019-01-06,00,,1-5,All OA; Green,Proceeding,"Akkad, Ghattas; Mansour, Ali; ElHassan, Bachar A.; Srar, Jalal; Najem, Mohamad; Le Roy, FrÃ©dÃ©ric","Akkad, Ghattas (Lab-STICC, UMR 6285, ENSTA Bretagne, Brest, France); Mansour, Ali (Lab-STICC, UMR 6285, ENSTA Bretagne, Brest, France); ElHassan, Bachar A.

However, due to the unstructured sparsity of SpTA, the general-purpose processors (e.g., GPU and CPU) are inefficient because of the underutilized hardware resources. Sparse kernel accelerators are optimized for specific tasks. However, their dedicated processing units and data paths cannot effectively support other SpTA tasks with different dataflow and various sparsity, resulting in performance degradation. This paper proposes FEASTA, a Flexible and Efficient Accelerator for Sparse Tensor Algebra. To process general SpTA tasks with various sparsity efficiently, we design FEASTA meticulously from three levels. At the dataflow abstraction level, we apply the Einstein Summation on the sparse fiber tree data structure to model the unified execution flow of general SpTA as joining and merging the fiber tree. At the instruction set architecture (ISA) level, a general SpTA ISA is proposed based on the execution flow. It includes different types of instructions for dense and sparse data, achieving flexibility and efficiency at the instruction level. At the architecture level, an instruction-driven architecture consisting of configurable and high-performance function units is designed, supporting the flexible and efficient ISA. Evaluations show that FEASTA has 5.40Ã geomean energy efficiency improvements compared to GPU among various workloads. FEASTA delivers 1.47Ã and 3.19Ã higher performance on sparse matrix multiplication kernels compared to state-of-the-art sparse matrix accelerator and CPU extension.

domains spanning from computer vision to natural language processing; however,
this happens at the expense of efficiency since they require increasingly more
memory and computing power. The power efficiency of the biological brain
outperforms any large-scale deep learning ( DL ) model; thus, neuromorphic
computing tries to mimic the brain operations, such as spike-based information
processing, to improve the efficiency of DL models. Despite the benefits of the
brain, such as efficient information transmission, dense neuronal
interconnects, and the co-location of computation and memory, the available
biological substrate has severely constrained the evolution of biological
brains. Electronic hardware does not have the same constraints; therefore,
while modeling spiking neural networks ( SNNs) might uncover one piece of the
puzzle, the design of efficient hardware backends for SNN s needs further
investigation, potentially taking inspiration from the available work done on
the artificial neural networks ( ANNs) side. As such, when is it wise to look
at the brain while designing new hardware, and when should it be ignored? To
answer this question, we quantitatively compare the digital hardware
acceleration techniques and platforms of ANNs and SNN s. As a result, we
provide the following insights: (i) ANNs currently process static data more
efficiently, (ii) applications targeting data produced by neuromorphic sensors,
such as event-based cameras and silicon cochleas, need more investigation since
the behavior of these sensors might naturally fit the SNN paradigm, and (iii)
hybrid approaches combining SNN s and ANNs might lead to the best solutions and
should be investigated further at the hardware level, accounting for both
efficiency and loss optimization.",,,arXiv,,,,2023-06-27,2023,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ottati, Fabrizio; Gao, Chang; Chen, Qinyu; Brignone, Giovanni; Casu, Mario R.; Eshraghian, Jason K.; Lavagno, Luciano","Ottati, Fabrizio (); Gao, Chang (); Chen, Qinyu (); Brignone, Giovanni (); Casu, Mario R.

in datacenters and at the edge. Specialized hardware is often necessary to meet
the performance requirements of state-of-the-art DL models, but the rapid pace
of change in DL models and the wide variety of systems integrating DL make it
impossible to create custom computer chips for all but the largest markets.
Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) present a unique blend of
reprogrammability and direct hardware execution that make them suitable for
accelerating DL inference. They offer the ability to customize processing
pipelines and memory hierarchies to achieve lower latency and higher energy
efficiency compared to general-purpose CPUs and GPUs, at a fraction of the
development time and cost of custom chips. Their diverse high-speed IOs also
enable directly interfacing the FPGA to the network and/or a variety of
external sensors, making them suitable for both datacenter and edge use cases.
As DL has become an ever more important workload, FPGA architectures are
evolving to enable higher DL performance. In this article, we survey both
academic and industrial FPGA architecture enhancements for DL. First, we give a
brief introduction on the basics of FPGA architecture and how its components
lead to strengths and weaknesses for DL applications. Next, we discuss
different styles of DL inference accelerators on FPGA, ranging from
model-specific dataflow styles to software-programmable overlay styles. We
survey DL-specific enhancements to traditional FPGA building blocks such as
logic blocks, arithmetic circuitry, and on-chip memories, as well as new
in-fabric DL-specialized blocks for accelerating tensor computations. Finally,
we discuss hybrid devices that combine processors and coarse-grained

models by mitigating the effects of process-induced and aging-related

minimize the overhead associated with adding these blocks, we present an
exploration algorithm to identify optimal insertion points for the denoising
blocks. Additionally, we propose a specialized architecture to efficiently
execute the denoising blocks, which can be integrated into mixed-signal
accelerators. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using Deep Neural
Network (DNN) models trained on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results

Given its undeniable importance, it is essential to explore how the underlying systems of software development and maintenance meet the demands of a digital world.Just as Mooreâs Law describes the trend of shrinking transistor sizes, a similar phenomenon can be observed in software engineering. Emerging technologies in both software engineering and underlying hardware performance drive down the time and cost of software development but at the same time, increase its complexity and capabilities. This raises two critical questions: How will software engineering evolve to meet the arising complexities, and how will we effectively monitor and manage the expanding IT systems? These questions shape the focus of this report: The future of software engineering and IT operations.Besides technological dimensions, broader societal, environmental, legal, and economic factors also play a critical role in this regard. For instance, how will increasing concerns about sustainability affect software development practices? What legal frameworks need to be updated to regulate AI and data privacy? And how will economic shifts and global labor shortages impact the talent pool for software engineers?The transformation of software engineering and IT operations brings new challenges that demand innovative business models. For example, improving the accessibility of digital products will require solutions that bridge technology and regulation. Furthermore, post-breach response strategies will be redefined and assessed in novel ways. Additionally, the education of computer science students must evolve to align with the future needs of the workforce.This report organizes these considerations into three sections: trends, exploration, and ideation. First, current trends across technical, societal, environmental, regulatory, economic, and legal domains are examined, analyzing their potential future impact on the IT industry.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its widespread application in various academic
and industrial fields have focused on designing and implementing a variety of
video compression and content delivery techniques to improve user Quality of

A new multi-loop control for a boost converter to reduce the low frequency input current harmonics drawn from the fuel cell is proposed. A new PWM technique for the cycloconverter at the secondary to reject the low order harmonics in the output voltages is presented in detail. The front-end boost converter regulates the de bus voltage effectively where the fuel cell voltage varies widely depending on the power demand, and provides a constant de voltage to the high frequency link dc-ac converter. The proposed multi-loop control reduces the low frequency (120Hz) input current harmonic of the boost converter without additional filter requirement in order to improve the performance of fuel cell system. The proposed PWM technique for the cycloconverter cancels the low order harmonics in the output voltage caused by the low frequency voltage ripple in the de bus and guarantees the high quality of the output voltage.

connected at the network edge, cultivating edge computing networks as a
fundamental infrastructure for supporting miscellaneous intelligent services.
Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence frontiers have extrapolated Machine Learning
to the graph domain and promoted Graph Intelligence (GI), which unlocks
unprecedented ability in learning from massive data in graph structures. Given
the inherent relation between graphs and networks, the interdiscipline of graph
representation learning and edge networks, i.e., Edge GI or EGI, has revealed a
novel interplay between them -- GI models principally open a new door for
modeling, understanding, and optimizing edge networks, and conversely, edge
networks serve as physical support for training, deploying, and accelerating GI
models. Driven by this delicate closed-loop, EGI can be widely recognized as a
promising solution to fully unleash the potential of edge computing power and
is garnering significant attention. Nevertheless, research on EGI yet remains
nascent, and there is a soaring demand within both the communications and AI
communities for a dedicated venue to share recent advancements. To this end,
this paper promotes the concept of EGI, explores its scope and core principles,
and conducts a comprehensive survey concerning recent research efforts on this
emerging field and specifically, introduces and discusses: 1) fundamentals of
edge computing and graph representation learning, 2) emerging techniques
centering on the closed loop between graph intelligence and edge networks, and
3) open challenges and research opportunities of future EGI. By bridging the
gap across communication, networking, and graph learning areas, we believe that
this survey can garner increased attention, foster meaningful discussions, and
inspire further research ideas in EGI.",,,arXiv,,,,2024-07-07,2024,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Zeng, Liekang; Ye, Shengyuan; Chen, Xu; Zhang, Xiaoxi; Ren, Ju; Tang, Jian; Yang, Yang; Xuemin; Shen","Zeng, Liekang (Sherman); Ye, Shengyuan (Sherman); Chen, Xu (Sherman); Zhang, Xiaoxi (Sherman); Ren, Ju (Sherman); Tang, Jian (Sherman); Yang, Yang (Sherman); Xuemin (Sherman); Shen ()",,"Zeng, Liekang (Sherman); Ye, Shengyuan (Sherman); Chen, Xu (Sherman); Zhang, Xiaoxi (Sherman); Ren, Ju (Sherman); Tang, Jian (Sherman); Yang, Yang (Sherman); Xuemin (Sherman); Shen ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174031735,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,

The state-of-the-art models for processing sequential data are self-attention-based transformer models. However, the computational complexity of self-attention is quadratic to the input sequence length, which often becomes the limiting factor in scaling the sequence length. Recently, state space model (SSM)-based global convolution models, which replace attention with convolution, have been found to be effective for modeling long sequences, with a sub-quadratic complexity using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However, they show sub-optimal performance on data-parallel accelerators like GPU, due to the regions of extremely low compute utilization with memory bandwidth-bound operations. To address this inefficiency, this paper proposes the Vandermonde matrix Generating Accelerator (VGA), a custom accelerator that performs FFT-based convolution in an area/power-efficient manner. VGA introduces Complex number Compute Units (CCUs) to fully utilize the high on-chip SRAM bandwidth, and parameters are generated on the fly to drastically reduce the required SRAM capacity. VGA achieves 76Ã(48Ã) higher area (power) efficiency than NVIDIA A100 GPU when executing the global convolution operator of H3, a state-of-the-art SSM-based model.","This work was supported by a research grant from Sam-sung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants funded by the Korea Government (MSIT) (RS-2024-00340008 and RS-2024- 00405857).

large language models answer wide-ranging questions, generate code, and write

their uses are exhilarating, the continually increasing model sizes and
computational complexities have a dark side. The economic cost and negative
environmental externalities of training and serving models is in evident
disharmony with financial viability and climate action goals.
  Instead of pursuing yet another increase in predictive performance, this
dissertation is dedicated to the improvement of neural network efficiency.
Specifically, a core contribution addresses the efficiency aspects during
online inference. Here, the concept of Continual Inference Networks (CINs) is
proposed and explored across four publications. CINs extend prior
state-of-the-art methods developed for offline processing of spatio-temporal
data and reuse their pre-trained weights, improving their online processing
efficiency by an order of magnitude. These advances are attained through a
bottom-up computational reorganization and judicious architectural
modifications. The benefit to online inference is demonstrated by reformulating
several widely used network architectures into CINs, including 3D CNNs,
ST-GCNs, and Transformer Encoders. An orthogonal contribution tackles the
concurrent adaptation and computational acceleration of a large source model

Unleashing the Power of PIM for Batched Transformer-based Generative Model Inference,"The Transformer-based generative model (TbGM), comprising summarization (Sum) and generation (Gen) stages, has demonstrated unprecedented generative performance across a wide range of applications. However, it also demands immense amounts of compute and memory resources. Especially, the Gen stages, consisting of the attention and fully-connected (FC) layers, dominate the overall execution time. Meanwhile, we reveal that the conventional system with GPUs used for TbGM inference cannot efficiently execute the attention layer, even with batching, due to various constraints. To address this inefficiency, we first propose AttAcc, a processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture for efficient execution of the attention layer.

learn, and execute tasks with human cognitive abilities, engenders significant
anticipation and intrigue across scientific, commercial, and societal arenas.
This fascination extends particularly to the Internet of Things (IoT), a
landscape characterized by the interconnection of countless devices, sensors,
and systems, collectively gathering and sharing data to enable intelligent
decision-making and automation. This research embarks on an exploration of the
opportunities and challenges towards achieving AGI in the context of the IoT.
Specifically, it starts by outlining the fundamental principles of IoT and the
critical role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in IoT systems. Subsequently, it
delves into AGI fundamentals, culminating in the formulation of a conceptual
framework for AGI's seamless integration within IoT. The application spectrum
for AGI-infused IoT is broad, encompassing domains ranging from smart grids,
residential environments, manufacturing, and transportation to environmental
monitoring, agriculture, healthcare, and education. However, adapting AGI to
resource-constrained IoT settings necessitates dedicated research efforts.
Furthermore, the paper addresses constraints imposed by limited computing
resources, intricacies associated with large-scale IoT communication, as well
as the critical concerns pertaining to security and privacy.",,,arXiv,,,,2023-09-14,2023,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Dou, Fei; Ye, Jin; Yuan, Geng; Lu, Qin; Niu, Wei; Sun, Haijian; Guan, Le; Lu, Guoyu; Mai, Gengchen; Liu, Ninghao; Lu, Jin; Liu, Zhengliang; Wu, Zihao; Tan, Chenjiao; Xu, Shaochen; Wang, Xianqiao; Li, Guoming; Chai, Lilong; Li, Sheng; Sun, Jin; Sun, Hongyue; Shao, Yunli; Li, Changying; Liu, Tianming; Song, Wenzhan","Dou, Fei (); Ye, Jin (); Yuan, Geng (); Lu, Qin (); Niu, Wei (); Sun, Haijian (); Guan, Le (); Lu, Guoyu (); Mai, Gengchen (); Liu, Ninghao (); Lu, Jin (); Liu, Zhengliang (); Wu, Zihao (); Tan, Chenjiao (); Xu, Shaochen (); Wang, Xianqiao (); Li, Guoming (); Chai, Lilong (); Li, Sheng (); Sun, Jin (); Sun, Hongyue (); Shao, Yunli (); Li, Changying (); Liu, Tianming (); Song, Wenzhan ()",,"Dou, Fei (); Ye, Jin (); Yuan, Geng (); Lu, Qin (); Niu, Wei (); Sun, Haijian (); Guan, Le (); Lu, Guoyu (); Mai, Gengchen (); Liu, Ninghao (); Lu, Jin (); Liu, Zhengliang (); Wu, Zihao (); Tan, Chenjiao (); Xu, Shaochen (); Wang, Xianqiao (); Li, Guoming (); Chai, Lilong (); Li, Sheng (); Sun, Jin (); Sun, Hongyue (); Shao, Yunli (); Li, Changying (); Liu, Tianming (); Song, Wenzhan ()",2,2,,1.72,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164085024,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,

service quality on edge platforms. However, training AI on resource-limited
devices poses significant challenges due to the demanding computing workload
and the substantial memory consumption and data access required by deep neural
networks (DNNs). To address these issues, we propose utilizing embedded dynamic
random-access memory (eDRAM) as the primary storage medium for transient
training data. In comparison to static random-access memory (SRAM), eDRAM
provides higher storage density and lower leakage power, resulting in reduced
access cost and power leakage. Nevertheless, to maintain the integrity of the
stored data, periodic power-hungry refresh operations could potentially degrade
system performance.
  To minimize the occurrence of expensive eDRAM refresh operations, it is
beneficial to shorten the lifetime of stored data during the training process.
To achieve this, we adopt the principles of algorithm and hardware co-design,
introducing a family of reversible DNN architectures that effectively decrease
data lifetime and storage costs throughout training. Additionally, we present a
highly efficient on-device training engine named \textit{CAMEL}, which
leverages eDRAM as the primary on-chip memory. This engine enables efficient
on-device training with significantly reduced memory usage and off-chip DRAM
traffic while maintaining superior training accuracy. We evaluate our CAMEL
system on multiple DNNs with different datasets, demonstrating a $2.5\times$
speedup of the training process and $2.8\times$ training energy savings than
the other baseline hardware platforms.",,,arXiv,,,,2023-05-04,2023,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Zhang, Sai Qian; Tambe, Thierry; Cuevas, Nestor; Wei, Gu-Yeon; Brooks, David","Zhang, Sai Qian (); Tambe, Thierry (); Cuevas, Nestor (); Wei, Gu-Yeon (); Brooks, David ()",,"Zhang, Sai Qian (); Tambe, Thierry (); Cuevas, Nestor (); Wei, Gu-Yeon (); Brooks, David ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157850584,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

equivalence between two programs made of sequences of statements. We represent
programs using abstract syntax trees (AST), where a given set of
semantics-preserving rewrite rules can be applied on a specific AST pattern to
generate a transformed and semantically equivalent program. In our system, two
programs are equivalent if there exists a sequence of application of these
rewrite rules that leads to rewriting one program into the other. We propose a
neural network architecture based on a transformer model to generate proofs of
equivalence between program pairs. The system outputs a sequence of rewrites,
and the validity of the sequence is simply checked by verifying it can be
applied. If no valid sequence is produced by the neural network, the system
reports the programs as non-equivalent, ensuring by design no programs may be
incorrectly reported as equivalent. Our system is fully implemented for one
single grammar which can represent straight-line programs with function calls
and multiple types. To efficiently train the system to generate such sequences,
we develop an original incremental training technique, named self-supervised
sample selection. We extensively study the effectiveness of this novel training
approach on proofs of increasing complexity and length. Our system, S4Eq,

tasks, e.g., computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement
learning, etc. The high-performed DNNs heavily rely on intensive resource
consumption. For example, training a DNN requires high dynamic memory, a
large-scale dataset, and a large number of computations (a long training time);
even inference with a DNN also demands a large amount of static storage,
computations (a long inference time), and energy. Therefore, state-of-the-art
DNNs are often deployed on a cloud server with a large number of
super-computers, a high-bandwidth communication bus, a shared storage
infrastructure, and a high power supplement.
  Recently, some new emerging intelligent applications, e.g., AR/VR, mobile
assistants, Internet of Things, require us to deploy DNNs on
resource-constrained edge devices. Compare to a cloud server, edge devices
often have a rather small amount of resources. To deploy DNNs on edge devices,
we need to reduce the size of DNNs, i.e., we target a better trade-off between
resource consumption and model accuracy.
  In this dissertation, we studied four edge intelligence scenarios, i.e.,
Inference on Edge Devices, Adaptation on Edge Devices, Learning on Edge
Devices, and Edge-Server Systems, and developed different methodologies to
enable deep learning in each scenario. Since current DNNs are often
over-parameterized, our goal is to find and reduce the redundancy of the DNNs
in each scenario.",,,arXiv,,,,2022-10-06,2022,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Qu, Zhongnan","Qu, Zhongnan ()",,"Qu, Zhongnan ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151716837,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4611 Machine Learning,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

criteria for designing meaningful metrics, and for methodologies that ensure
that we can dependably and efficiently measure these metrics at scale and in

Within this frame, we cover topics that fit under three different themes. First, we quantify and mitigate sources of arbitrariness in machine learning, with respect to hyperparameter optimization and social prediction contexts. We clarify important connections between machine-learning arbitrariness, rooted in non-determinism, with legal notions of arbitrariness that implicate legal rules and due process. Second, we tame randomness in uncertainty estimation and optimization algorithms, in order to achieve scalability without sacrificing reliability. We discuss how across computing, and particularly in machine learning, scalability and reliability are typically in trade-off. Analogous trade-offs in law and policy make this type of trade-off a useful abstraction for communicating about machine-learning capabilities and risks to policymakers and other non-expert stakeholders.
